# Expense-Manager-With-React


### This is a simple UI based application to manage expense list and add new expenses. 
### Currently, there is some dummy data that loads whenever the application is loaded on the browser.

### This application has been built using React with JavaScript. I have used some custom styling with raw css. 

### In the future, I will try to integrate it with a working Backend and manage the data dynamically.
